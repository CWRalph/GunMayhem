# GunMayhem
2D Shooter Replica

Throughout our time in High School this game stood out as a simple yet compelling browser game that was a blast at the time but slowly became a passion project as 
my friend and I tried to replicate the game ourselves. Full credit of the game goes of course to the creators, simply search Gun Mayhem into your browser, however,
using the game itself as a template, my fellow programmer Naashon McFarlane and I planned and created the entirety of the code ourselves using C++ and the RayLib library for drawing and animations.
